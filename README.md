# MOPLA_on_Matlab

MOPLA_on_Matlab (based on works of Bhandari and Jiang 2021, Qu et al 2016, Jiang 2016, Jiang 2014) is a Matlab-implementation of the Multi-Order-Power-Law Approach(MOPLA) to simulate rock fabric development in Earth's lithosphere.

Some of the basic use case of geological scenarios include: 
1. Deformation of a rheologically stronger element embedded in a heterogeneous rock medium
2. Deformation of a rheologically weaker element embdedded in a heterogeneous rock medium
3. Pressure in and around a rheologically stronger or weaker element embedded in a heterogeneous rock medium


These geological problems include:

--> Evaluating pressure in and around rheologically heterogenous elements of Earth's lithosphere.

--> A multiscale approach that couples MOPLA with VPSC(Lebensohn and Tome 1993) model of crystallographic fabric development 
    to study the influence of flow partitioning on crystallographic fabric

--> Simulating of 3-D flanking structures in ductile shear zones.

(P.S. The code in this repository works well, but will be reorganized in a more presentable format in near future! Please feel free to ask any questions at abhand3@uwo.ca)
