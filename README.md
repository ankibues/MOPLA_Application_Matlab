# MOPLA_on_Matlab

MOPLA_on_Matlab (based on works of Bhandari and Jiang 2021, Qu et al 2016, Jiang 2016, Jiang 2014) is a Matlab-implementation of the Multi-Order-Power-Law Approach(MOPLA) to simulate rock fabric development in Earth's lithosphere.

Some of the basic use case of geological scenarios include: 
1. Deformation of a rheologically stronger element embedded in a heterogeneous rock medium
2. Deformation of a rheologically weaker element embdedded in a heterogeneous rock medium
3. Pressure in and around a rheologically stronger or weaker element embedded in a heterogeneous rock medium
4. Simulating crystallographic fabric development by coupling MOPLA with VPSC model (Lebensohn and Tome 1993)
5. Simulating flanking structures in ductile shear zones.
