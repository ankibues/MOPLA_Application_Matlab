# MOPLA_Application_Matlab
This repository contains MATLAB code that uses MOPLA (Qu et al 2016, Jiang 2016, JIang 2014) for application to specific geological problems.


MOPLA is a multiscale numerical model to simulate heterogeneous deformation in Earth's ductile lithosphere(Jiang 2014, Jiang 2016). This repository
adds new code development related to MOPLA, specifically regarding its application for different geological problems.
